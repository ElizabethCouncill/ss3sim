These copies have been hosted here with permission from Rick Methot. ss3sim relies on a specific format of SS3 configuration files and has been tested specifically with Version 3.24O.

ss3sim requires the SS3 binary files to be in your operating system's path. Also, on Unix, you may need to add executable permissions to the file. See Appendix A in the vignette `vignette("ss3sim-vignette")` for instructions.
