#' Example time series data output
#'
#' These data represent the output from a simple example in which the
#' observation error on a survey is manipulated. Case \code{D0} refers
#' to the base case and case \code{D1} refers to a case in which the
#' standard deviation on the survey observation error is halved.
#' 
#' Since the file size of these time series output data can be large,
#' we have reduced the output to 15 iterations.
